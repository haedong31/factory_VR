# Behavioral Modeling of Collaborative Problem Solving in Multiplayer Virtual Reality Manufacturing Simulation Games
A GitHub repository for the research project of developing a VR simulation game for manufacturing education and a learning analytics method.

## Abstract
Engineering is an inherently creative and collaborative endeavor to solve real-world problems, in which collaborative
problem solving (CPS) is considered one of the most critical professional skills. Hands-on practices and assessment
methods are essential to promote deeper learning and foster the development of professional skills. However, most
existing approaches are based on out-of-process procedures such as surveys, tests, or interviews that measure the
effectiveness of learning activity in an aggregated way. It is desirable to quantify CPS dynamics during the learning process.
Advancements in virtual reality (VR) provide great opportunities to realize digital learning environments to facilitate a
learning-by-doing curriculum. In addition, sensors in VR systems allow us to collect in-process user behavioral data. This
paper presents a multiplayer VR manufacturing simulation game for virtual hands-on learning experiences, as well as a
behavioral modeling method for monitoring the CPS skills of participants. First, we developed the Virtual Learning Factory,
where users play simulation games of various manufacturing paradigms. Second, we collected action logs from a sample of
participants and used the same pattern to generate more data. Third, the behavioral data are modeled as dynamic networks
for each player. Last, network features are calculated, and a CPS scoring method is driven from them. Experimental results
show that the proposed behavioral modeling successfully captures different patterns of CPS dynamics according to
manufacturing paradigms and individuals. This detailed assessment contributes to the development of appropriate studentspecific
interventions to improve learning outcomes.
